# DVOTE - NEXT JS frontend

This dapp allows users to register themselves as authority for conducting an election.   
The authority then can add candidates and voters and conduct an election. Once election is  
finished the results are delcared.  
The votes pushed are immutable and so the election process becomes much more secure, immutable and safe.


This is a Prototype design - has not been finished.
